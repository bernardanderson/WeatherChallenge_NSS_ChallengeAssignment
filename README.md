# NSS Project: "Open Weather API Application"

### Specs:
> Allow users to input a ZIP code and retrieve the 5 day forecast from the Open Weather API

1. Use base Web Technologies
 * HTML5
 * CSS
 * JavaScript

### Technologies Used:
> 1. HTML5, CSS, JavaScript


### Final Result:
##### Basic 1, 5 or 10 Day Weather Forecast Application
> This simple application was an early "Challenge" assignment in the NSS curriculum. The student was tasked with building an application that pulled weather information from the Open Weather API. The original specs required a 5-day forecast by I allowed for a 1, 5 and 10 day forecast as well.  

> This got students acquainted with JSON parsing, API calls, and regular expressions all using vanilla JavaScript. 

### How to run:
```
1. Go to: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server` and install "http-server".  
2. Navigate to the project folder in command line interface and type: `http-server -p 8080`  
3. This will show at: `http://localhost:8080` in your internet browser.  
```

### Original Specs:

Challenge \#2
Whither the Weather?

This challenge is to get additional experience with XHR's and working with API's.

Use the OpenWeather API to build a weather forecast search tool

* Pick three types of forecasts to choose from
* User inputs zipcode and selects forecast type from a dropdown
* Use an xhr to fetch the api data. The syntax will be just like the calls you have written to fetch a local JSON file, only you'll be pulling in remote data. It will return the data in JSON by default
* Present the returned data in a nicely styled display. Use a image to accompany the forecast/conditions, such as a cloud with raindrops when the chance for precip is above a certain percentage.
* The UI should use Bootstrap

You must sign up to receive an API key

Example of an API call to get a 5-day forecast for 37201
> api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=37201&APPID=1111111111
